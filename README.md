# LandslideV1

Code for Landslide Detection System for IDE Maker 2024.

## Topic Description
IDE is partnering with World Robot Olympiad (WRO) Singapore for this year’s competition theme: “Earth Allies”.
In 2024, teams will learn more about how we humans affect nature and how nature and natural events can affect us. 
How can your project solution help us live in harmony with nature? 
Can your project solution help us live in places where nature is dangerous or harsh, and can they assist us in living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle?

## The stuff we're using
- Vibration sensor
- DC motor
- Moisture sensor
- Traffic Light RGB
- LCD Display
- Force Sensor
- Vibration motor (IIS)
- PIR sensor (extra)

## Rationale
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/clementi-landslide-three-sections-of-park-connector-open-but-a-stretch-will-remain-closed-until-end-2023
550m stretch of the connector along the south bank of Sungei Ulu Pandan near the landslip zone, as well as the north bank which will open in March, makes up 16 per cent of the park connector 
Impact:
Lives disrupted. Danger could have been costly. Flood concerns. Housing construction disrupted.
There were an average of four landslide incidents reported to Building and Construction Authority (BCA) per year between 2017 and 2019, and 21 per year in 2020 and 2021. 
As seen in Figure 1, annual rainfall generally increases 
by 100mm per decade. When cross-referencing 
with the above information, we can infer that annual rainfall 
may possibly be increasing at an exponential rate as of recent years.
As we know that landslides are often catalysed by heavy rainfall,
we can thus infer that landslides may occur more frequently and
therefore pose a threat to civilians.
As seen in Source 2, a passer-by was injured during the landslide
near Clementi. This further proves the harm of landslides in Singapore,
validating the plausibility of a system to detect and alert passers-by quickly.
